# Tiney

The challenge is to implement [register feature of Tiney](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15OaqYC2Ko8yLXh-GE8S6Qj7bkD2FD8UQ8uHhIAbPQk4/edit), where providers can record the times that children attend their nursery each day. 

## User Stroies
As a childcare provider, Iâ€™d like to :
- [x] see a list of children who attend my setting including their current register status (signed in or signed out)
- [x] be able to sign in or sign out a child with a single tap from this screen
- [x] be able to see the log of register entries for a specific date
